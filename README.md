# Web Widgets

Transparent web pages for your desktop, emulating the technique and form factor of [OBS browser sources](https://obsproject.com/kb/browser-source)

You could use this, for example, with [discord's streamkit overlays](https://streamkit.discord.com/overlay)

This is a work in progress and highly experimental

⚠️ Be aware that using this alongside games with intrusive anti-cheat may risk your account, as cheaters sometimes do similar things with their software (always on top, click through, transparent)
